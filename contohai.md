Using the provided image of a social media profile, create a hyper-realistic 3D render of a transparent acrylic profile card held delicately between the thumb and index finger of one hand with proportionally smaller fingers. The card should be facing directly toward the viewer in a clean, frontal angle, showing all visible content from the original — profile photo, name, username, bio, and links — neatly arranged and clearly legible. Make the card appear physically real with convincing thickness, glossy reflection, and light refraction through clear glass material. The text and icons must look physically etched or printed on the acrylic surface with subtle depth and soft drop shadows. Use soft glowing pastel edges in mint and lavender hues, set against a solid background in a complementary cool tone light aqua or icy lavender. Frame the image with a slight zoom for clarity and professional composition. Apply studio-quality lighting for realism and ensure all facial features and text remain exactly as they appear in the original.
